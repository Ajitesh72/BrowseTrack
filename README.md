# Network Traffic Analysis Dashboard with Kibana

Welcome to the Network Traffic Analysis Dashboard project! This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for analyzing and visualizing network traffic data using Kibana, a powerful data visualization tool commonly used with Elasticsearch.

## Overview

Network traffic analysis is crucial for understanding the behavior of data flowing through networks, identifying patterns, and detecting anomalies or security threats. This project leverages Kibana to create interactive dashboards that offer insights into various aspects of network traffic, including volume trends, top talkers, protocol distribution, port utilization, connection durations, and attack detection.

## Features

- Visualize network traffic volume over time with time series line charts.
- Identify top talkers (IP addresses) generating or receiving the most traffic using bar charts or pie charts.
- Analyze protocol distribution and port utilization with pie charts or stacked bar charts.
- Explore connection durations and detect anomalies with histograms or box plots.
- Monitor and analyze detected attacks with bar charts or pie charts.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Install Elasticsearch and Kibana.
2. Ingest network traffic data into Elasticsearch.
3. Create index patterns and visualizations in Kibana.
4. Build interactive dashboards to analyze network traffic.
